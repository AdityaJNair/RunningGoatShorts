The following program was built on JRE 1.8

Instructions for running this program on the bash command line:

(1) Download scheduler.jar, and place it into the directory of your choice.

(2) Open a terminal and navigate to the directory.

(3) If your machine uses JRE 1.8 by default, execute 

                java -jar scheduler.jar "input graph" "processor count" "[OPTIONS]"
    
NOTE: The University of Auckland's UG4 lab computers use JRE 1.7 by default at time of writing, and some libraries may be incompatible. To run the scheduler on such a machine, instead execute:

                /usr/lib/jvm/jre1.8.0_45/bin/java -jar scheduler.jar "input graph" "processor count" "[OPTIONS]" 

Instructions for starting up program on your IDE:

(1) Download the RunningGoatShorts folder into your workspace.

(2) Create a new Java Project called RunningGoatShorts, make sure the name is correct or the files will not be visible.

(3) There will be library errors, right click on Referenced Library -> build path -> configure build path and add the jar files in 306 Project/src/resources:
                gs-core-1.3.jar
                gs-algo-1.3.jar
                gs-ui-1.3.jar
                PTRuntime.jar

(4) Go on run configurations and on the arguments tab type in:
                "input graph" "processor count" "[OPTIONS]"
  
(5) Run it.
